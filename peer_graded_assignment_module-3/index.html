                            A widespread belief says that in June 1889 the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito, Pizzeria Brandi's chef, invented a dish called "Pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, and the Italian unification, since toppings are tomato (red), mozzarella (white) and basil (green), representing the same colors of the national flag of Italy.[2]

                            The legend of pizza Margherita is considered a false history, as a pizza made with the same toppings was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810,[3] although it probably was not called "Margherita". In 1830, in the book Napoli, contorni e dintorni, written by Riccio, it was described as a pizza with tomato, mozzarella and basil.[4] In 1849 Emanuele Rocco recorded different pizza toppings like basil, tomatoes and thin slices of mozzarella;[5] the mozzarella was thinly sliced, and arranged with a flower-shape over the tomato sauce, along with the basil leaves: this may be the real origin of the name Margherita (meaning daisy).[6]

                            In 1866 Francesco De Bourcard, writing about the Naples traditions,[5] described the most commonly used pizza toppings at that time, included the ones called today pizza marinara, pizza margherita and calzone:

                           The most ordinary pizzas, called coll'aglio e l'olio (with garlic and oil), are dressed with oil, and over there it's spread, as well as salt, the origanum and garlic cloves shredded minutely. Others are covered with grated cheese and dressed with lard, and then they put over a few leaves of basil. Over the firsts is often added some small seafish; on the seconds some thin slices of mozzarella. Sometimes they use slices of prosciutto, tomato, arselle, etc.... Sometimes folding the dough over itself it forms what is called calzone.

                        <p>
                            Neapolitan pizza (Italian: pizza napoletana) also known as Naples-style pizza, is a style of pizza made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. It must be made with either San Marzano tomatoes or Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a protected designation of origin cheese made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state and “Fior di Latte di Agerola”, a cow milk mozzarella made exclusively in the Agerola comune.[1] Neapolitan pizza is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) product in Europe, and the art of its making is included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[2] This style of pizza gave rise to the New York-style pizza that was first made by Italian immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century.[3]
                            la cheese and slices of fresh tomato, which may also be flavoured with garlic.

                            The legend of pizza Margherita is considered a false history, as a pizza made with the same toppings was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810,[3] although it probably was not called "Margherita". In 1830, in the book Napoli, contorni e dintorni, written by Riccio, it was described as a pizza with tomato, mozzarella and basil.[4] In 1849 Emanuele Rocco recorded different pizza toppings like basil, tomatoes and thin slices of mozzarella;[5] the mozzarella was thinly sliced, and arranged with a flower-shape over the tomato sauce, along with the basil leaves: this may be the real origin of the name Margherita (meaning daisy).[6]

                           In 1866 Francesco De Bourcard, writing about the Naples traditions,[5] described the most commonly used pizza toppings at that time, included the ones called today pizza marinara, pizza margherita and calzone:

                           The most ordinary pizzas, called coll'aglio e l'olio (with garlic and oil), are dressed with oil, and over there it's spread, as well as salt, the origanum and garlic cloves shredded minutely. Others are covered with grated cheese and dressed with lard, and then they put over a few leaves of basil. Over the firsts is often added some small seafish; on the seconds some thin slices of mozzarella. Sometimes they use slices of prosciutto, tomato, arselle, etc.... Sometimes folding the dough over itself it forms what is called calzone.
